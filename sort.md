# Sorting Algorithm
. Selection sort  
. Insertion sort   
. Bubble sort   
. Counting sort   
. Heap sort  
. Merge sort   
. Quick sort   
. Radix sort  
. Bucket sort    

## The above sorting algorithms are different from each other on the basis of their number of swaps,time and space complexities etc.  

> Worst case time complexity of heap and merge sort is **O(nlog(n))** while for quick sort,selection sort,insertion sort,bubble sort it is **O(n^2)**.  

## Real life use of algorithms
> Bubble sort is used in programming tv to sort the channels according to user's viewing time.  
> Merge sort is used in database to sort the set of data that is too large to be loaded.  
> Quick sort is used to organize the sport scores.
